Mars, the "Red Planet," is the fourth planet from the Sun, a cold, desert-like world with a thin carbon dioxide atmosphere, iron-rich soil giving it a rusty hue, and features like giant volcanoes (Olympus Mons) and canyons (Valles Marineris). It has polar ice caps, two small moons (Phobos & Deimos), seasons, and a day (sol) just longer than Earth's, though its year is nearly twice as long. Mars is a key focus for space exploration, with missions discovering frozen water and potential signs of past life, with human landings planned for the future.
