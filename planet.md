<h1>Planet Pluto</h1>

Pluto is a famous dwarf planet in the icy Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, reclassified from its long-held status as the ninth planet in 2006 by the IAU because it hasn't cleared its orbital path of debris. It's a small, cold, icy world with mountains, plains, a thin atmosphere, and five moons, notably Charon, explored up close by NASA's New Horizons mission. Pluto is not a planet.
